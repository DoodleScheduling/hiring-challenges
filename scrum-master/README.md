# The challenge (Scrum Master)
## User stories
You have a Product Owner who is new to the role and needs help with writing good user stories. Please point out possible issues for each of the stories below:
1. `As a user, I want to have the whole Doodle flow unified according to the latest design guidelines, so it feels more modern.`
2. `As a participant, I want to get #28AD28 notification when submitting my option, so I am notified that my vote was successfully submitted`
3. `As a Product Owner, I want to have an authentication on the poll creation page, so I can login to my account.`
4. `As a participant, I want to see date and timezone display with correct time on the submit button before selecting my vote.`
## Delivery process
Two newly formed Scrum Teams will work on products that share the same frontend components and backend services. Please prepare a kick off presentation for the teams in which you will describe the delivery process for them and assess the potential risks.

# Delivery

The presentation should take up to 20 minutes. At the end we will have an open conversation about your strategy to approach the challenge.
