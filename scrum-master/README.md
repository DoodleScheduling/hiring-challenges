# The challenge (Scrum Master)
## User stories
You have a Product Owner who is new to the role and needs help with writing good user stories. Please point out possible issues for each of the stories bellow:
1. `As a user, I want to have the whole Doodle flow unified according to the latest design guidelines, so it feels more modern.`
2. `As a participant, I want to get #28AD28 Nag when submitting my option, so I am notified that my vote was successfully submitted`
3. `As a Product Owner, I want to have an authentication on the poll creation page, so I can login to my account.`
4. `As a participant, I want to see date and timezone display with correct time on the submit button before selecting my vote.`
## Delivery process
There are two newly formed Scrum Teams that will work on products that share the same frontend components and backend services. Please prepare 10 mins kick off presentation for the teams in which you will describe the delivery process for them and assess the potential risks.
