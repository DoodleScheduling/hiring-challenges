# The challenge (Tech Lead)

As a Tech Lead you will be working closely with the entire team and when it comes to helping the 
Product Manager, you will be their sparring partner, discussing what it takes to get the team's
roadmap executed.

Because of that, we would ask you to do the [Fullstack challenge](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/hiring-challenges/tree/master/fullstack-engineer). We don't expect you to be an expert in both backend and frontend necessarily, 
but you should be able to talk to engineers from both ends. We are not looking for perfection though,
we are looking for someone that can lead the team that executes it perfectly.

If you think that, the Fullstack challenge is not for you, you could do either the [Backend challenge](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/hiring-challenges/tree/master/backend-engineer) or the [Frontend challenge](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/hiring-challenges/tree/master/frontend-engineer).

your email subject would be `TL-Paul Smith`

We will review your solution, we strive to get back to you in **1 week**. Sometimes it might take more.
