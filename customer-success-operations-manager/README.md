# The challenge (Customer Success Operations Manager)

Adventure Works Cycles, a large wholesaler of bicycles in the US and Europe, have approached you as their 
 customer success operations manager to help them analyse their ~ 400 customer base.  They would like to better 
 understand their customer base, who is doing well and who might need support from a Customer Success Manager.

The company’s IT department has provided you with the company’s sales data over the last few years.
In the absence of any consultation with the business, you will need to examine this data on your own and decide 
which key elements you will focus on in your analysis. 

## Data

The Adventure Works Cycles purchase order data is a real, open dataset published by Microsoft. 
Here, we make a condensed version available in a large CSV contained inside `adventure_works_purchase_orders.tar.gz`. 

## Deliverables

As an outcome of this test, we expect you to send us two documents:

1. A PDF slide deck (<10 slides) detailing your strategic assement of the customer base to be presented to
 AdventureWorks' head of customer success. 
It should be self-sufficient, i.e. must be understandable by the reader without any further comments.
2. Any supporting analysis done to produce all figures/graphs that appear in your presentation 
(jupyter notebook, excel sheet, sql queries etc)

As this is based on an open dataset, please refrain from trying to find pre-made solutions 
online as we would like you to present your own, not someone else's work.

## Rules

We understand your time is precious and would not want you to spend more than 
**6 to 8 hours** on this over the span of **one week** max - as you will also be assessed on how you are able to 
prioritise analysis in a short timeframe and work on the most important parts first. 

## Evaluation

Send an email with a link to your repository solution.

It will be assessed based on:
- Your ability to distill strategic recommendations from a large(-ish) data set.
- Your ability to communicate your insights in a clear and simple manner to a target-audience.
- Your ability with data analysis.

We will review your solution, we strive to get back to you in **1 week**. Sometimes it might take more.
