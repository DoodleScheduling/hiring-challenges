# The challenge (QA Manager)

Imagine you are going to join an organization with the following structure:
* There are several cross-functional teams, let’s say 7
* These teams are formed by frontend, backend, full-stack engineers, product managers, and designers for example.
* Each different team in the organization has a separate QA process
* Historically, the company didn’t employ QA resources directly, but instead, it has used nearshore services.

As QA Manager, your role is to make Quality Assurance a first class citizen in the organization. You will be brought in to lead the QA topic and make sure that when it comes to QA, everyone is on the same page.

Having that in mind we would like you to put together a presentation, telling us how you would go about tackling the following topics:

## Creating a common understanding company-wide on Quality Assurance
As a leader part of your job will be to facilitate common understanding of complex concepts. For example, every engineer should know what an integration test means in their context.

## Creating a company-wide QA framework
With clear definitions of the different types of tests, when they should be executed and who should own the different types. 

## Standardizing the process and tooling
Different teams have different needs, but having a common set of tools and processes that teams should align to has several benefits. Show to us what tools you would use and what process would bring QA to the core of the company’s teams.

# Delivery

The presentation should take up to 45 minutes. It gives you at least 15 minutes for each topic, but feel free to use your time as you wish. At the end we will have an open conversation about your strategy to approach the challenge.
