# The challenge (Delivery Manager)
## User stories
You have a Product Owner who is new to the role and needs help with writing good user stories. Please point out possible issues for each of the stories below:
1. `As a user, I want to have the whole Doodle flow unified according to the latest design guidelines, so it feels more modern.`
2. `As a participant, I want to get #28AD28 notification when submitting my option, so I am notified that my vote was successfully submitted`
3. `As a Product Owner, I want to have an authentication on the poll creation page, so I can login to my account.`
4. `As a participant, I want to see date and timezone display with correct time on the submit button before selecting my vote.`
## Delivery process
Two newly formed Scrum Teams will work on products that share the same frontend components and backend services. Please prepare a kick-off presentation for the teams in which you will describe the delivery process for them and assess the potential risks.
## Recruitment
1. Your company is looking for 2 frontend engineers - one for your team and the second one for the other product team. The desired profile is the same in terms of experience and skills. How would you organize an efficient recruitment process for those 2 roles (what recruitment steps would you include, how would you split responsibilities between 2 teams, how would you decide to which team the candidate fits best)?

2. Your company is rapidly growing and you are responsible for hiring 2 fullstack engineers for your team. Unfortunately, for a couple of weeks, your pipeline is lacking promising candidates. Youâ€™ve shared the job ad with your friends and posted it on your LinkedIn dashboard but that did not help to attract more candidates. Provide 3 examples of concrete actions that you would take next to encourage more engineers to apply for that roles.
# Delivery

The presentation should take up to 20 minutes. At the end we will have an open conversation about your strategy to approach the challenge.
