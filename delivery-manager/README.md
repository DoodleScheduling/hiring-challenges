# The challenge (Delivery Manager)
## User stories
You have a Product Owner who is new to the role and needs help with writing good user stories. Please suggest improvements to the story below, if any, and add any information you think might be missing.

`As a user, I want to have the whole Doodle flow unified according to the latest design guidelines, so it feels more modern.`

## Delivery process
Two newly formed Scrum Teams will work on one product and hence the same frontend components and backend services. They will work one one backlog representing this product.  There is one product owner in place for backlog management.  Please prepare a kick-off presentation for the teams in which you will describe the delivery process for them and assess the potential risks.

## People Management
1. One of your team members recently started to complain more about the team meetings and became less engaged in the team discussions. In which way you would approach this situation?
2. One of your team members is pushing for a promotion to a next level technical role, but you know that they are not functioning at a level required for that role and they are not ready for it.   How do you handle this?

## Recruitment
Your company is rapidly growing and you are responsible for hiring 2 fullstack engineers for your team. Unfortunately, for a couple of weeks, your pipeline is lacking promising candidates. Youâ€™ve shared the job ad with your friends and posted it on your LinkedIn dashboard but that did not help to attract more candidates. Can you come up with any ideas that you would might try next to encourage more engineers to apply for these roles?

# Presentation
The presentation should take up to 20 minutes. At the end we will have an open conversation about your strategy to approach the challenge.
