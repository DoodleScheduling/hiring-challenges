# The challenge (Head of Engineering)
## Line out change management to focus on one goal
The product development team-structure of Doodle looks like this:
* Six cross-functional product development teams with engineering (frontend, backend, QA), product (PM, design), process (delivery lead) roles.
* One team is purely backend focussed, two teams are heavy backend, three teams heavy frontend
* All teams are currently switching from Scrum process to Kanban
* Five product development teams work on features for one persona only (organizer, participant, admin...)
* Two of the teams are working in a combined process on the delivery of the future customer-facing Doodle.
* Teams are not co-located and the team members are either people managed by the tech lead or the process lead.
* Engineers are organized in chapters to align between teams
* There is a weekly cross-team alignment session with all delivery and tech leads and PMs
* A design operations team is currently working on a design system and new component library that will get used in the future (3 frontend engineers and one designer)
* A principals team owns the technical vision and roadmap of the company and also QA and security processes and guidelines. The principals are also mentoring the engineers of the product development teams.

The goal for the second half of the year for the five product development teams described above is to focus on the future-customer facing Doodle only.
You will be managing those 5 teams.

Which changes in the team-setup, process and management would you introduce and communicate for a shorter time to market of all deliverables?
