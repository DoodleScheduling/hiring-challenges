# The challenge (Data Analyst)

Adventure Works Cycles, a large wholesaler of bicycles in the US and Europe, has noticed that their total profits have been declining over the last few months. They have approached you to help them analyzing what are the drivers of this change.

The company’s IT department has provided you with the company’s sales data over the last few years. In the absence of any consultation with the business, you will need to examine this data on your own and decide which key elements you will focus on in your analysis.

## Data

The Adventure Works Cycles purchase order data is a real, open dataset published by Microsoft. Here, we make a condensed version available in a large CSV contained inside `adventure_works_purchase_orders.tar.gz`. 

## Deliverables

As an outcome of this test, we expect you to send us two documents:

1. A PDF slide deck (<10 slides) detailing your strategic recommendations for AdventureWorks' executive committee. It should be self-sufficient, i.e. must be understandable by the reader without any further comments.
2. A runnable jupyter-notebook containing all figures that appear in your presentation.

As this is based on an open dataset, please refrain from trying to find pre-made solutions online as we would like you to present your own, not someone else's work.

## Rules

We understand your time is precious and would not want you to spend more than **6 to 8 hours** on this over the span of **one week** max. The outcome should be runnable locally on a UNIX-flavored OS (MacOS, Linux).

## Evaluation

Send an email with a link to your repository solution.

It will be assessed based on:
- Your ability to distill strategic recommendations from a large(-ish) data set.
- Your ability to communicate your insights in a clear and simple manner to a target-audience.
- Your ability with Python data analysis.

We will review your solution, we strive to get back to you in **48 hours**. Sometimes it might take more.
