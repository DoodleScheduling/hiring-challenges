# The challenge (Junior Scrum Master)
## User stories
You have a Product Owner who is new to the role and needs help with writing good user stories. Please point out possible issues for each of the stories below:
1. `As a user, I want to have the whole Doodle flow unified according to the latest design guidelines, so it feels more modern.`
2. `As a participant, I want to get #28AD28 notification when submitting my option, so I am notified that my vote was successfully submitted`
3. `As a Product Owner, I want to have an authentication on the poll creation page, so I can login to my account.`
4. `As a participant, I want to see date and timezone display with correct time on the submit button before selecting my vote.`
## Scrum Process
Please prepare a 10 minutes presentation during which you will answer the following questions:
1. Near the end of the Sprint, a severe bug in the Production environment is reported. Sprint Scope does not allow enough buffer to deal with the bug and still deliver the feature set as planned. Product Owner is away and cannot be reached. How do you proceed?
2. There was a lot of turmoil within the team regarding the technical implementation of a feature. The team would like to involve a CTO during the retrospective. What should you do to ensure that Retrospective ceremony is successful?
3. Few Team Members during the Stand-up identified that they need to sit down together and discuss a complex technical integration with an external service. You didnâ€™t have the opportunity to attend the meeting, but after half an hour you see the QA engineer from the team leaving the meeting room crying. What are your next steps?
