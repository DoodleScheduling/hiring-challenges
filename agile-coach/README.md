# The challenge (Agile Coach)
## Agile process in the principals team
The product development team-structure of a mid-size company looks like this:
* 6 cross-functional product teams with engineering roles (frontend, backend, devops), a ScrumMaster, a designer, and a product manager
* Teams are not co-located
* Engineers are organized in chapters to align between teams
* A principals team owns the technical vision and roadmap of the company and also QA and security processes and guidelines
* Members of the principals team are the director of engineering, principal engineers with backend, frontend, devops and data focus, and a security manager and a QA manager
The goal of the team is to work on the roadmap, processes, and PoCs. The idea is a service-oriented team with team members that are jumping into the other cross-functional teams to implement the processes and PoCs that the principals aligned on first.
What kind of process should the principals team itself have to unblock the other teams without principals being bottlenecks?

## Alignment in chapters
The chapters don't have leads for alignment. The members of a chapter have to align without supervision. What is needed to make this work? And how can a reporting channel to the principals look like.

# Delivery

Prepare a retrospective or coaching session for the principals team. Try to build up alignment and set action points for team members and next sessions.
In the next interview, you will have the prepared session with the team. Additional guests will be one or two of Doodle's delivery managers.
