# The challenge (Quality Analyst)

## Part 1
Imagine these hypothetical scenarios and write down answers to these questions:
1. Support writes in your teamâ€™s chat about a big bug in production - what do you do?
2. In the daily standup, you hear that we need to deliver very fast and cannot implement unit tests - how would you react to that?
3. Team you recently joined is confused about the role of the QA. How would you explain it to them in a few sentences?

## Part 2

Here comes the main part of this challenge... your automated testing skills. Use a programming language of your choice. 

Head over to our [QA BE challenge repository](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/qa-backend-challenge) for further instructions.

P. S. In case you're not comfortable with API or performance testing, we have another option for you:
Given the UI of doodle.com, how would you design your automation framework using the Page Object Model? Please share a github repo with a basic skeleton test setup. Nothing complicated, just one test case that we could run. For example, you could show us how you would test the functionality of creating and voting on a poll. You are free to create the test run in whatever way you feel is best, but some things we would look for are how you structure your Page Objects, and how you would automate the behaviors and make assertions.

# Rules

We value your time and respect your time management on how much time you want to spend on this task. We would ask you to complete this challenge over the span 
of **1 week** max. 

Combine your answers into a text document (for example, PDF). For part 2, share a URL to a Github repository. 

# What we expect
It is OK if the challenge is not complete/perfect. Try to **prioritize** it based on what you think is most important. 
We want to understand what motivates your choices, how you tackled the task, and what you would do if you had more time.

# Next steps
Send an email with a link to your repository solution to `code-challenge@doodle.com`.

Make sure your email has the following subject: `QA-<yourname>`. For example, if your name is "Paul Smith", 
your email subject should be `QA-Paul Smith`.

We will review your solution as soon as possible and strive to get back to you in **1 week**. Sometimes it might take more.
