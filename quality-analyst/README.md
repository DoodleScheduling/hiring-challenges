# The challenge (Quality Analyst)

## Part 1
Imagine these hypothetical scenarios and write down answers to these questions:
1. Support writes in your teamâ€™s chat about a big bug in production - what do you do?
2. In the daily standup, you hear that we need to deliver very fast and cannot implement unit tests - how would you react to that?
3. Team you recently joined is confused about the role of the QA. How would you explain it to them in a few sentences?

## Part 2
Explore Doodle.com:
1. What, in your opinion, is the main business value functionality?
2. How would you approach the quality strategy of a website like doodle.com?
3. Did you find any bugs? If yes, write down one of them.
4. Suggest 3 quality improvements that could be made to doodle.com that you observed.
5. Given this UI, how would you design your automation framework using the Page Object Model?
