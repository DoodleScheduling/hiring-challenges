# The challenge
When users go to their [dashboard](https://doodle.com/dashboard) on doodle.com, they will see a list of the doodles they have either created or
participated. Internally we call a doodle a _poll_.

We would like you to implement a simple Restful API with similar functionality. This is the functionality that your API
should support:

1. List all polls created by a user
2. Search polls by its title
3. List all polls created after a certain date

The design of the API is up to you.

In the **assets** folder you can find a JSON file, which contain some data for you. We expect the responses from your
API to match the shape of the polls in that file.

The outcome should be runnable locally using docker-compose or Kubernetes. Please provide all instructions (or a documented script) needed to run your assignment (i.e. how to build the images and run the containers).

# Rules
We understand your time is precious and would not want you to spend more than **3 to 5 hours** on this over the span 
of **1 week** max. 

Please use a **VM language**, preferably Java. Feel free to use any framework, like Spring for example.

# What we expect
It is OK if the challenge is not completed. Try to **prioritize** it by what you think is more important. Tell us what 
motivated your technology choices, how you tackled the task, what you would do differently were you given more time, 
what you would differently a second time around, etc.

Here are some pointers for you of things we will be looking for:

* Commit often, write useful commit messages
* Design, we do like attention to detail
* Code readability
* Performance 

# Next steps
Send an email with a link to your repository solution to `code-challenge@doodle.com`.

Make sure your email has the following subject: `BE-<yourname>`. So for example, if your name were "Paul Smith", 
your email subject would be `BE-Paul Smith`

We will review your solution, we strive to get back to you in **48 hours**. Sometimes it might take more.
