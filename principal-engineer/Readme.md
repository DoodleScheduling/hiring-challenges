# The challenge (Principal Engineer)
You have two options, we have a challenge for engineers focused on the __Backend__ and another one
if your are an experienced engineers building complex __Frontend__ applications. Please choose the 
one that suits you better.

If you have most of your experience on the __Backend__ please do this challenge here: [Backend challenge](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/hiring-challenges/tree/master/backend-engineer). In case you have a stronger __Frontend__ background, 
please do this one instead: [Frontend challenge](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/hiring-challenges/tree/master/frontend-engineer).

# What we expect

As a Principal Engineer at Doodle we fully expect you to be hands-on. So we would like to see how 
you code. Once we have reviewed your code we will get into a more high-level and strategic
conversation about how you would tackle some other problems that involve architecture and cross team
challenges.

"Paul Smith", your email subject would be FE-Paul Smith

We will review your solution, we strive to get back to you in __48 hours__. Sometimes it might take more.
